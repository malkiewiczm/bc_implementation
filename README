This repo contains two separate assignments for a class (programming
language concepts) and there extensive tests.

The folder titled "bc_antlr4" is a complete implentation of the posix
program "bc", which stands for "basic calculator", but despite this
actually has statements as complicated as function definitions, if
statements, for and while loops, and calls to some built in
functions. This project will take code (see the tests), parse it to an
intermediate byte code, then run that byte code, all using java +
antlr4.

The folder title "bc_ocaml" is only an implmentation of the runtime
for bc. It assumes that you are given the abstract syntax tree of a bc
program, and then it will run it. The reason this is present in this
repo is mainly for good taste, to show how much more elegent things
are in a functional language compared to java.
